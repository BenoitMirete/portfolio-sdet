# Portfolio SDET - Benoit Mirete

Welcome to my professional portfolio dedicated to my skills and projects as a Senior SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test). This repository serves as a showcase of my automation frameworks, API testing, end-to-end test scripts, and infrastructure automation.

## About Me

I am Benoit Mirete, a Senior Freelance SDET with extensive experience in test automation and quality assurance processes within Agile environments. I specialize in designing, building, and maintaining end-to-end automation frameworks primarily using Playwright and TypeScript, ensuring reliable, regression-free releases for both B2B and B2C web platforms.

With a strong background in CI/CD integration, infrastructure automation with Terraform and Ansible, and a proactive approach to quality control, I help development teams improve QA practices and accelerate delivery cycles. My expertise spans performance testing, manual testing, detailed bug reporting, and defect lifecycle management.

Fluent in English and French, I am passionate about continuous improvement, cybersecurity, and process optimization. Beyond work, I enjoy painting, photography, and board games, which help fuel my creativity and attention to detail.
